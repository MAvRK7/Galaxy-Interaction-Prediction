# Explainable Galaxy Interaction Prediction with Novel Hybrid Attention Mechanisms

This study compares GAN, CGAN, and ContraGAN models for generating synthetic data to predict the B-V color index in astronomy. ContraGAN achieved the best performance with the lowest MSE (0.1294) and highest RÂ² (0.7258), as well as superior clustering. CGANs improved accuracy through feature conditioning, while standard GANs underperformed. The results highlight the value of contrastive learning and conditional generation for scientific data applications.
